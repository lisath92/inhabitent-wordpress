# WordPress Project - Inhabitent Theme

## About
Inhabitent is a pseudo e-commerce company that sells camping equipment that we created using WordPress. We used the provided RED Starter boilerplate to build our custom theme tailored to the company. This is a project based on our understanding of the PHP language and how it ties in with WordPress.

## Tools and Methods Used 
+ *HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript* - These are the basic languages that we have learned from the previous projects and we reused to create the content, presentation and the behaviour layers of this project.
+ *PHP* - This is the new language we have been taught in the past 2 weeks and the main focus of this roject is to know how and when to incorporate the correct syntax of PHP.
+ *WordPress* - WordPress in itself has many methods and functions that are available to us. The main loop displaying the posts in WordPress was provided to us and we had to understand the concept in order to manipulate it to suit our custom theme. Using the Codex, we are asked to perform several tasks such as retrieving the post dates, authors, comments, etc. 

##General Overview
I found this project to be a bit more challenging since it is the first time I have used WordPress and we were asked to created several different pages as well as custom pages. Writing PHP is not too difficult for me, but finding the correct WordPress functions was a little harder than expected. However, in the end, I feel that I have gained a lot of experience in working with PHP and WordPress through this project.
